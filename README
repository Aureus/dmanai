This is the main repo for contestants in dmangame
(http://github.com/okayzed/dmangame). If you'd like for other players to be
able to play against your AI, fork this repository and add your AI to it.

To run an AI from a user's repository, supply an AI string in the following format:

github_user:path_to_dep1.py,path_to_dep2.py,path_to_ai_module.py

for example:

  python main.py okayzed:okay/okay.py,okay/goose.py ai/killncapture.py


This will download dmanai/okay/okay.py and dmanai/okay/goose.py and instantiate
an AI instance from the AI in goose.py to run against the local file
ai/killncapture.py.

Remember to look at AIs before you run them, as you are running remote code and
it can potentially be dangerous.

The AI strings also work with appengine, which is slightly more secure for the
end user.
